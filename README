xoutputd
========

xoutputd is a daemon that monitors the connection state of outputs and
then executes commands based on defined rules.

The main use-case is to change, via an xrandr call, the screen layout
when monitors are being connected/disconnected.


How to build it
===============

xoutputd depends on:

    * libX11
    * libXrandr
    * lex compatible lexer generator
    * yacc compatible parser generator

To build:

    cd xoutputd
    make

The Makefile has been tested with GNU make and NetBSD make.


How to use it
=============

xoutputd is intended to be executed via the ~/.xsession script:

   xoutputd &

Outputs and errors will be written in the ~/.xsession-errors file.


Configuration file
==================

The default configuration file is "$HOME/.xoutputdrc" but another file
can be specified with the -f switch.

Comments can be anywhere in the file, they start with a hash mark (#)
and extend to the end of the line.

The configuration file is composed of one or multiple rules. A rule
describes the state of outputs and the command to execute when the
connection of those outputs will be in the described state.

The rules are evaluated in order, and the first one to match will
decide the command to execute.

The syntax of a rule is as follow:

   when `output_name` [ + `output_name` ]* (connected | disconnected) exec "command"

The command to execute must be surrounded by double-quotes.

A rule can be splitted on multiple lines.


Configuration example
=====================

    # disable all outputs when HDMI1 and DP2 are disconnected
    when HDMI1+DP2 disconnected
    exec "xrandr --output HDMI1 --off --output DP2 --off --output eDP1 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 0x0 --rotate normal"

    # execute a script when two monitors are plugged-in
    when HDMI1+DP2 connected exec "sh ~/.screenlayout/dual_monitors.sh"
